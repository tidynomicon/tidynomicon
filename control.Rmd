Chapter \@ref(basics) said that modern R strongly encourages people
to write vectorized code.
There are times, though, when we need to write loops and conditionals,
and we should *always* break our code up into single-purpose functions.

## How do I choose and repeat things?

We cherish the illusion of free will so much that we embed a pretense of it in our machines
in the form of conditional statements using `if` and `else`.
Ironically,
we then instruct those same machines to make the same decisions over and over.
Here,
for example,
is a snippet of Python that displays the signs of a list of numbers:

```{python}
values = [-15, 0, 15]
for v in values:
    if v < 0:
        sign = -1
    elif v == 0:
        sign = 0
    else:
        sign = 1
    print("The sign of", v, "is", sign)
```

Its direct translation into R is:

```{r}
values <- c(-15, 0, 15)
for (v in values) {
  if (v < 0) {
    sign <- -1
  }
  else if (v == 0) {
    sign <- 0
  }
  else {
    sign <- 1
  }
  print(paste("The sign of", v, "is", sign))
}
print(paste("final value of v is", v))
```

There are a few things to note here:

1.  This is *not* how we should write R:
    everything in this snippet can and should be vectorized.
2.  The parentheses in the loop header are required:
    we cannot simply write `for v in values`.
3.  The curly braces around the body of the loop
    and around the bodies of the conditional branches are optional,
    since each contains only a single statement.
    However, they should always be there to help readability.
4.  The loop variable `v` persists after the loop is over.
5.  `paste` converts its arguments to strings and concatenates them,
    placing a single space between each unless instructed to do otherwise.
    `print` then prints the resulting (single) string.
    The function `cat` (short for "concatenate") can also be used for text output.
6.  By calling our temporary variable `sign`
    we have accidentally overwritten the rather useful built-in R function with that name.
    [Name collisions](glossary.html#name-collision) of this sort are as easy in R as they are in Python.

## How can I express a range of values in R?

By default, R's `for` loop gives us the values in a vector, just as Python's does.
If we want to loop over the indices instead,
we can use the function `seq_along`:

```{r}
colors = c("eburnean", "glaucous", "wenge")
for (i in seq_along(colors)) {
  print(paste("The length of color", i, "is", length(colors[i])))
}
```

This makes no sense at all until we remember that every value is a vector,
and that `length` returns the length of a vector,
so that `length(colors[0])` is telling us that `colors[0]` contains one element.
If we want the number of characters in the strings,
we can use R's built-in `nchar` or the function `stringr::str_length`:

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(colors)) {
  print(paste("The length of color", i, "is", stringr::str_length(colors[i])))
}
```

`seq_along` returns a vector containing a sequence of integers:

```{r}
seq_along(colors)
```

Since sequences of this kind are used frequently,
R lets us write them using [range expressions](glossary.html#range-expression) like this:

```{r}
5:10
```

Their most common use is as indices to vectors:

```{r}
colors <- c("eburnean", "glaucous", "squamous", "wenge")
colors[1:3]
```

We can similarly subtract a range of colors by index:

```{r}
colors[-1:-3]
```

However, R does not allow tripartite expressions of the form `start:end:stride`.
For that,
we must use the `seq` function:

```{r}
seq(1, 10, 3)
```

This example also shows that ranges in R are inclusive at both ends,
i.e.,
they run up to *and including* the upper bound.
As is traditional among programming language advocates,
people claim that this is more natural,
and then cite as proof some supportive anecdote such as,
"Most people do not interpret the expression 'from one to five'
to mean 'one, two, three, or four'."

## How can I use a vector in a conditional statement?

We cannot use vectors directly as a condition in an `if` statement:

```{r error=TRUE}
numbers <- c(0, 1, 2)
if (numbers) {
  print("This should not work.")
}
```

Instead,
we must collapse the vector into a single logical value.

```{r}
numbers <- c(0, 1, 2)
if (all(numbers >= 0)) {
  print("This, on the other hand, should work.")
}
```

The function `all` returns `TRUE` if every element in its argument is `TRUE`;
it corresponds to a logical "and" of all its inputs.
We can use a corresponding function `any` to check if at least one value is `TRUE`,
which corresponds to a logical "or" across the whole input.

## How do I create and call functions?

As we have already seen,
we call functions in R much as we do in Python:

```{r}
max(1, 3, 5) + min(1, 3, 5)
```

We define a new function using the `function` keyword.
This creates the function, but does not name it;
to accomplish that,
we must assign the newly-created function to a variable:

```{r}
swap <- function(pair) {
  c(pair[2], pair[1])
}
swap(c("left", "right"))
```

As this example shows,
the result of a function is the value of the last expression evaluated within it.
A function can return a value earlier using the `return` function;
we can use `return` for the final value as well,
but most R programmers do not.

```{r}
swap <- function(pair) {
  if (length(pair) != 2) {
    return(NULL) # This is very bad practice.
  }
  c(pair[2], pair[1])
}
swap(c("one"))
```

```{r}
swap(c("left", "right"))
```

Returning `NULL` when our function's inputs are invalid as we have done above is foolhardy,
as doing so means that `swap` can fail without telling us that it has done so.
Consider:

```{r}
NULL[1]                 # Try to access an element of the vector that does not exist.
```

```{r}
values <- 5:10          # More than two values.
result <- swap(values)  # Attempting to swap the values produces NULL.
result[1]               # But we can operate on the result without error.
```

We will look at what we should do instead in \@ref(errors).

## How can I write a function that takes a varying number of arguments?

If the number of arguments given to a function is not the number expected,
R complains:

```{r error=TRUE}
swap("one", "two", "three")
```

(Note that in this example we as passing three values,
not a single vector containing three values.)
If we want a function to handle a [varying number of arguments](glossary.html#variable-arguments),
we represent the "extra" arguments with an ellipsis `...` (three dots),
which serves the same purpose as Python's `*args`:

```{r}
print_with_title <- function(title, ...) {
  title <- paste("==", title, "==\n")
  items <- paste(..., sep = "\n")
  cat(title)
  cat(items)
  cat("\n")
}
print_with_title("to-do", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")
```

R has a special data structure to represent the extra arguments in `...`.
If we want to work with those arguments one by one,
we must convert `...` to a list:

```{r}
add <- function(...) {
  result <- 0
  for (value in list(...)) {
    result <- result + value
  }
  result
}
add(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

## How can I provide default values for arguments?

Like Python and most other modern programming languages,
R lets us define default values for arguments,
and then pass arguments by name:

```{r}
example <- function(first, second = "second", third = "third") {
  print(paste(first, "+", second, "+", third))
}

example("with just first")
example("with first and second by position", "positional")
example("with first and third by name", third = "by name")
```

One caution:
when you use a name in a function call,
R ignores non-function objects when figuring out what function to call.
For example, the call `orange()` in the code below produces 110
because `purple(purple)` is interpreted as
"pass the value of the local variable `purple` into the globally-defined function `purple`":

```{r}
purple <- function(x) x + 100
orange <- function() {
  purple <- 10
  purple(purple)
}
orange()
```

## How can I hide the value that R returns?

If the value returned by a function isn't assigned to something,
R will print it out.
This isn't always what we want,
particularly in library functions,
so we can use the function `invisible` to mark a value
so that it won't be printed by default
(but can still be assigned).
This allows us to convert this:

```{r}
something <- function(value) {
  10 * value
}
something(2)
```

to this:

```{r}
something <- function(value) {
  invisible(10 * value)
}
something(2)
```

The calculation is still done,
but the output is suppressed.

## How can I assign to a global variable from inside a function?

The assignment operator `<<-` means "assign to a variable outside the current scope".
As the example below shows,
this means that what looks like creation of a new local variable can actually be modification of a global one:

```{r}
var <- "original value"

demonstrate <- function() {
  var <<- "new value"
}

demonstrate()
var
```

This should only and always be done with care:
modern R strongly encourages a [functional](glossary.html#functional-programming) style of programming
in which functions do not modify their input data,
and *nobody* thinks that modifying global variables is a good idea any more---especially not
after what happened to poor Professor Peaslee.
